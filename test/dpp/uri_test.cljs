;;   2. the SubjectPublicKeyInfo, which this file BUILDS by hand from a real
;;      P-256 point produced by Node's ECDH, so the bytes dpp.uri parses were
;;      not produced by dpp.uri.

;; Every negative control pins the REASON, not just the failure. A refusal test
;; that only asserts "not ok" passes when the refusal came from somewhere else
;; entirely -- which is how a check stops discriminating without saying so.
